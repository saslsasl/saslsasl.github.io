# lede-project
project 1!

Hello!

My first lede project is <i> hot off the press. </i>

I fly a lot, and I always want to fly with my dog. She wants to fly with me too-- she loves the in flight movies. Problem is, navigating airline in-cabin pet policies is incredibly time consuming and disturbing, only less disturbing than the idea of forcing her into cargo. So I wanted to get all the airline weight policies in one place. Here's the result!

If I had more time, I would:
- make a more interactive and pretty web design
- scrape more recent data
- scrape data from non US airlines
- make sure that you can't input some crazy number, like > 200 lbs

But alas, life is short, and here we are.
